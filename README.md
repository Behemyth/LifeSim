# LifeSim
A framework for creating a simple life simulation in a simple environment.

Muscles, bones, and their connection are modeled with Bullet physics. After their creation, a nueral netowrk with knowledge with all scene data and creature data controls movement towards arbitrary goals of eating, sleeping etc. Creatures that do not fullfil basic requirements die and succesfull ones create similar creatures with variations in their bone or muscle structure.

To build you must be running visual studio 2013 and then copy glew.dll to your system32 file or the respective project exe path.

# Notes
While the project no longer in development, the code provided contains a framework for Bullet physics, OpenGL and simple muscle connections allowing for limb movement.
